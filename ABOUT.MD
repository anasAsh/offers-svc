## Language and frameworks
I used JS (node/react) to domenstrate my skills in this language, most of my recent experiences are around JS, i prefered what i am familiar with and interested to learn more about at the moment.

## what you wanted to accomplish?
- A scaleable working/auto tested MVP for a node app without using frameworks.
- A working/auto tested MVP for the UI.

## What I learned?
- There are a ton of stuff i don't know about unit testing in Node.
- Using React for an MVP can be an overkill.

## Something I want to do:
- Better unit testing.
- Enable CI/CD in my repo.
- Fancy UI and client side validations for filters.
- better UI in general.
- speerate client from server code to make it easier to release chanegs without worry.
- Could have used graphQl for this.
- Easier debugging on Heroku.
- be able to see my app actually working on Heroku, as requests were being blcoked by expedia servers returning the bot page.

## Thought process
- at first I thought i would finish this project much faster than what happened, started with the simplest soultions and built on it, later, i figured that i should have thought more about the backend validations for the API filters, which made me spend some extra time on refactoring some parts.
